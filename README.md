This is a new GitHub repository for my "new-project" project. Here are the steps for creating a new development branch:

1. Go to your new repository on the GitHub website.
2. Click on the "Branch: main" button near the top left corner of the screen.
3. In the "Find or create a branch" field, enter "dev" to create a new development branch.
4. Click on the "Create branch: dev" button to create your new development branch.

That's it! You can now switch to the dev branch and start working on new features without affecting the main branch.
